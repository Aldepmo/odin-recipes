    <h2>Buffalo Chicken Pasta Salad</h2>

    <p>For anyone who likes Buffalo wings, this is a great change of pace from normal pasta salad. Really popular as a side dish for a barbeque or just about any gathering you can think of. You can substitute or add many different vegetables with this recipe.</p>

    <ul><h3>Ingredients</h3></ul>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package uncooked rotini pasta</li>
    <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>1 cup chunky blue cheese dressing</li>
    <li>1/2 cup buffalo wing sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1 pound frozen cooked chicken strips, defrosted and diced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup red bell pepper, diced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup green bell pepper, diced</li>
    <li>1 cup red onion, diced</li>

    <ol><h3>Directions</h3></ol>
        <li><em><strong>Step 1</strong></emZ></li>
            <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the rotini, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</p>
        <li><em><strong>Step 2</strong></emZ></li>
            <p>Stir together the mayonnaise, blue cheese dressing, buffalo wing sauce, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add the chicken, bell peppers, red onion, and cooked pasta and toss to coat with the dressing. Cover and chill at least 1 hour in the refrigerator before serving.</p>
